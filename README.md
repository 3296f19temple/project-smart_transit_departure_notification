# Smart Departure Transit Notification
John Brown, Eric Hart, Steven Nardo, Jake Wells

## Vision Statement
For public transit users who miss their trains/busses, Smart Transit Departure Notification (clever name pending) is an app that presents departure times from nearby public transit stations to the user in the form of a persistent notification on their phone. Unlike the Septa app, our product makes finding the next departure times at any station as easy as looking at your lockscreen.

## Personas

#### Persona 1
Miranda, aged 24, is a manager at a café in center city Philadelphia. She often times both opens and closes the store when working, usually during weekends as well as weekdays. She is from a town in south New Jersey; her father is a plumber and active in his local union and her mother is a nurse anesthetist at their local hometown hospital. Miranda attended Drexel University for Marketing and has lived in Philadelphia, the neighborhood of Queens Village, since starting her bachelor’s degree, i.e. for around 6 years.

Miranda’s frequent use of SEPTA transit services such as the subway and the public bus system, as well as the PATCO lines makes her adept in traversing public transit and not a stranger to using multiple transit methods at once. This being said, working such strenuous hours and at various times of the day often result in Miranda falling asleep or getting distracted during her commute to and from work. A feature such as the departure notification would greatly ease her multi-step commute as well as ease her anxiety about missing any stops.

#### Persona 2
Billy, aged 27, is an office worker living in University City. Billy is from outside of Boston, and he moved to Philadelphia for work. He has a degree in Printed Document File Management from Boston College. His father is a mime, and his mother won a bronze medal in skiing at the '94 Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway.

Billy uses a computer for his job as well as for internet browsing and streaming. On the weekends, Billy likes to go out with his friends. This brings him to many different parts of the city. Billy prefers to use the subway because of its simplicity and because of a lack of familiarity with the bus system. Billy finds himself in odd parts of the city at odd times, so being able to quickly know the nearest subway station to him, the next departure times from that station, and the last trip of the day would be invaluable to Billy to ease his commute home.

#### Persona 3

#### Persona 4

Chris, age 17, is a high school student living in Downingtown, PA where he was born and raised. His father works in IT for an insurance company and his mother is a paralegal. Chris has no aspirations as to what he will do with his life outside of high school but is somewhat invested in his endeavours as a soundcloud rapper under the name "Yung Void". He currently works as a part time cashier at Wawa.

Chris enjoys visiting Philadelphia on weekends with his friends to see live music performances and attend college parties. Neither him or his friends own a car so they take the regional rail and local trains to get to and around the city. Chris and his friends are still new to subway system and often times find themselves confused and stressed when trying to make it to their trains on time. An application that can familiarize Chris with the train system and send push notifications of departure times would ease the anxiety of navigating SEPTA and create a more positive experience for Chris and his friends when they want to go to the city.
