## Personas

#### Persona 1
Miranda, aged 24, is a manager at a café in center city Philadelphia. She often times both opens and closes the store when working, usually during weekends as well as weekdays. She is from a town in south New Jersey; her father is a plumber and active in his local union and her mother is a nurse anesthetist at their local hometown hospital. Miranda attended Drexel University for Marketing and has lived in Philadelphia, the neighborhood of Queens Village, since starting her bachelor’s degree, i.e. for around 6 years.

Miranda’s frequent use of SEPTA transit services such as the subway and the public bus system, as well as the PATCO lines makes her adept in traversing public transit and not a stranger to using multiple transit methods at once. This being said, working such strenuous hours and at various times of the day often result in Miranda falling asleep or getting distracted during her commute to and from work. A feature such as the departure notification would greatly ease her multi-step commute as well as ease her anxiety about missing any stops.
